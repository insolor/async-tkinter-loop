Install the package with the following command:

```
pip install async-tkinter-loop
```
or
```
pip install async-tkinter-loop[examples]
```

- `[examples]` part is needed to install optional dependencies (such as `httpx` and `pillow`) to run some of the
  examples. If you're not going to run examples, remove the `[examples]` part from the command
- Use `pip3` instead of `pip` on Linux systems to install the package for python3 (not python2)
- Probably you'll want to create a virtual environment for experiments with this library, but this is optional.
- If you want to try examples, download the entire repository as an archive (green "code" button on
  [the GitHub page](https://github.com/insolor/async-tkinter-loop) â†’
  "Download ZIP"), unpack, run any example (of course, you need to install optional dependencies)
